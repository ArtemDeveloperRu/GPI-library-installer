# install-libory-GPU

**Graphical interface for working with Python libraries. This program allows you to remove libraries, download and view a list of installed libraries. To install the library you need to write the name of the library and click install and in the terminal write y or n if you write y then the installation will continue if n (no) then the download will stop. In the same way, you just need to click on the delete button to delete. And when we want to see a list of libraries, we need to click on the "Library Lists" button and we do not need to specify anything in the field, since we just want to see a list of installed libraries. There are also F1 hotkeys.**
